Description: This project provides a group of new functions to calculate
    the outputs of the two main components of the Canadian Forest Fire
    Danger Rating System (CFFDRS) Van Wagner and Pickett (1985)
    <https://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/publications?id=19973>) at various time
    scales: the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System Wan Wagner (1985)
    <https://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/publications?id=19927> and the Fire Behaviour
    Prediction (FBP) System Forestry Canada Fire Danger Group (1992)
    <https://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/pubwarehouse/pdfs/10068.pdf>. Some functions
    have two versions, table and raster based.
